            Leaders often work tirelessly to improve their company’s product or
            service, thinking that it’s the most valuable role they c an play.
            But for your business to “click” with your target audience, you need
            to stay just as close to your customers as you do to your
            offerings.A value proposition is a simple statement that summarizes
            why a customer would choose your product or service. It communicates
            the clearest benefit that customers receive by giving you their
            business. Every value proposition should speak to a customer’s
            challenge and make the case for your company as the problem-solver.
            You may be wondering: Why bother learning how to write a value
            proposition? It’s like investing in the foundation of a house. You
            may not see the foundation, but everything you do see — and the
            long-term safety and security of your home — rest on it having a
            strong place to start from. If you’re intentional about creating a
            value proposition, it can help clarify the way forward for your
            entire company. However, including too many voices early on can
            water down your intent in an effort to make everyone happy, and,
            ironically, the results won’t work for anyone.
